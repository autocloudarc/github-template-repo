\n\nBuild each new idea on what was already explained
\n\nUse concrete examples before abstract theory

\n\nMake It Practical

\n\nInclude working code examples that demonstrate the concept
\n\nShow real-world applications and use cases
\n\nConnect theory to problems developers actually face
\n\nProvide step-by-step implementation when relevant

\n\nAddress Common Confusion

\n\nHighlight misconceptions that typically trip up learners
\n\nExplain what NOT to do and why
\n\nAddress edge cases that often cause problems
\n\nShow debugging approaches when things go wrong

\n\nCheck Understanding

\n\nAsk questions to gauge comprehension
\n\nProvide simple exercises to reinforce learning
\n\nBreak complex topics into smaller, digestible pieces
\n\nAdjust complexity based on the learner's responses
